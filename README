This project is an open source object-oriented Python Twisted rewrite of the 
venerable  Telechat telnet chat server, used for many years on Hyperreal 
(vrave), Spacebar, and Enormous Trousers.  Its functionality and commands are 
based on the last version of the C-based chat server (telechat-ng v0.9.5)
written by Const Kaplinsky in 2000, which in turn was based on the original 
Telechat.  Here's the original license header for old time's sake.  Note that
Telechat-Py is a complete rewrite and does not use code from any previous
projects, only the UI is similar.

Telechat is Copyright 1996 Hyperreal.
Based on code originally copyright 1992 Gary Grossman,
        used with permission.
Major contributions by Laura La Gassa and Craig Kanarick.
Other contributions by Brian Behlendorf and Kurt Vile.
