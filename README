==============================================================================

This project is an open source object-oriented Python Twisted rewrite of the 
venerable  Telechat telnet chat server, used for many years on Hyperreal 
(vrave), Spacebar, and Enormous Trousers.  Its functionality and commands are 
based on the last version of the C-based chat server (telechat-ng v???).

The project is hosted here:  http://github.com/skyepn/telechat-py
